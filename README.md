## Next external auth boilerplate

Next.js boilerplate with authentication and an external API backend.

### Backend

This boilerplate was built as a Frontend counterpart to my other boilerplate [express-auth-boilerplate](https://github.com/jonathan-franzen/express-auth-boilerplate).

Make sure to check that out for a fullstack authentication project and a working out-of-the-box solution.

## Usage

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```
